# The problems and advantages of centralized data
In this homework, I discuss two articles about the pros and cons of using centralized data, which refers to a system where all data is stored in a single location, such as a central server or a central database. In a centralized data system, data is stored in a centralized repository, and access to this data is typically controlled by a single entity or a small group of entities. I present and discuss two opposing views on this issue.

## Article 1
According to the paper [3 reasons centralizing your data is a bad idea?](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3622240/3-reasons-centralizing-your-data-is-a-bad-idea.html), consolidating data in one place has a number of drawbacks. Due to a centralized system's single point of failure, there is a higher danger of data breaches, which is the primary justification. The second issue is that it is challenging to maintain data quality since mistakes in a single central repository might have an impact on the veracity of data across the entire system. The third reason is that people are losing control over their personal information since they are depending on one organization to handle their data. To reduce these dangers, the author advises enterprises to look at decentralized solutions.

The use of centralized data systems is examined critically in this article, with a focus on the potential downsides and security issues associated with such systems.

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in previous article on the issue, Mitchell J's [The Benefits of Centralized Data: A Single Source of Information for Your Business Entities](https://www.diligent.com/insights/data-management/the-benefits-of-centralized-data-a-single-source-of-information-for-your-business-entities/), published on Diligent Insights, is an article that discusses the benefits of centralized data management. The author argues that centralizing data can provide several benefits for businesses, including improved data quality, better decision-making, and increased operational efficiency. According to the author, having a single source of information can produce data that is more reliable and consistent and assist organizations avoid problems caused by having various, siloed data sources.

The article also emphasizes how centralizing data can promote data sharing and collaboration, resulting in improved coordination and communication among various departments and business units. Additionally, the author points out that centralized data systems can facilitate real-time reporting and analytics, which can assist firms in making wise decisions and acting rapidly in response to shifting business requirements. The article's conclusion highlights that centralized data administration can offer a number of benefits, making it a crucial factor to take into account for businesses wishing to advance their data management procedures.
